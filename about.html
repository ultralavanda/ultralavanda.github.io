	<br>Who am I
	<br>Carlos, born in Spain in the middle of the 80s. Studied Fine Arts and Photography, worked in almost everything related to tourism, and recently became a teacher of art and visual media. Movie theaters are my safe space and pop culture is my favourite conversation topic.
	
	<br><br>	About the blog
	<br>It was created on January 2025. I'd like to get back the ability to focus for a longer time and I think it'll do me good to express myself in a long-form text, as opposed to tweets or Instagram stories.  I've felt overwhelmed with the noise of social media for a long time and I miss the Geocities/LiveJournal/Blogspot era, when I would visit my internet buddies' blogs, each with a different visual and literary style. I was under the impression that those sites were all gone, but a quick search on Reddit led me to Blogroll.org, where I found a mine of unique personal blogs.
	
	<br>	As of now, this website consists of a handful of HTML files and one CSS file, all coded on Visual Studio Code and hosted on a GitHub repository. Simple static pages are as far as my coding skills can take me for now.  I love blogs that keep it light and simple and I would like to follow that path. I've used WordPress before and there are features I'll miss, like RSS, but I find great satisfaction from creating something from scratch like I just did.
	
	<br><br>Why Ultralavanda: 
	<br>When brainstorming for a domain name, some of the things I saw around me were my phone with a lavender case and a bottle of Ultraviolet by Paco Rabanne. Spanish it up, and there you go.
